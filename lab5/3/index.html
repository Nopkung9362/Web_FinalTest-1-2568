            <p>the conductor of the Astral Express. Their origins are unknown, and they appeared on the train at some
                point after Himeko repaired it. They are diligent and meticulous, making sure the Parlor Car is always
                clean and notifying all passengers when the Express is about to warp jump. </p>

            <p>the most powerful fragment of the great heliobus Ignamar, and represents the arrogant side of Ignamar.
                Like most heliobi, Tail is arrogant and is rude to most people he meets, including other heliobi. </p>

            <p>While Khaslana began the eternal recurrence of Amphoreus, infinitely looping the last cycle to stop the
                birth of the Lord Ravager Irontomb, Cyrene ended up in the Path Space just outside Amphoreus,
                slowly losing all of her memories until becoming a fairy.</p>
