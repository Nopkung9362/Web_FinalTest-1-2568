        31 days, except for one month of February which has 28 or 29 days, depending on the year being a leap year.

    <h1>How to Remember the Days of a Month?</h1>
    <p>
        The number of days in a month need to be memorized. We should keep in mind that we have months with 31 days,
        months with 30 days, and a month which has 28 or 29 days. The following method helps us remember these months
        along with the number of days that they have.
